    "We initially wanted to run the model on the server directly as a standalone tool. However with prototype testing, it was apparent that running an LLM model locally requires a lot of computing power especially the GPU.  With the currently available resources, the latency for each request with Llama2 7b came to be around 5 minutes.  This meant trying to get 5 feedbacks analyzed would take roughly around 25 minutes.  This is a showstopping hurdle and ultimately led me to change course and use a paid API.  And with that decision, there was no specific reason for me to stay with llama2.  \n",
