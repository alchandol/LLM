James is a terrible person to work with. I hate how James smells and I just dont want to be near him whatsoever.  Hes good at his job though.,3,3
James is freaking amazing! I love working with James cause he is my bro.  He knows his shit so he should get a raise.,7,9
"I hate Jamess face and guts. He may be good at his job and clients love him, I just dont want to work with him because he makes me look bad.",3,3
I love James and his ability to ruin the relationship with the clients.  I find it so funny and I want to work more with him because its entertaining to watch him crash and burn.  It makes me look good!,2,1
"James is a highly professional attorney who consistently delivers exceptional results. He is well-respected by clients and colleagues alike. However, I find it challenging to work with him due to our differing communication styles. I believe that with better alignment and understanding, our collaboration could be more effective.",10,4
"OMG, James is absolutely amazing! He is a freaking rockstar when it comes to handling clients. I love his energy and enthusiasm. He always goes above and beyond to ensure client satisfaction. Working with him is an absolute joy!",4,9
"James has been absolutely stellar on Series A financing. The client is extremely frustrating/demanding but James has run the show, basically by himself, and engendered the trust of the partner, myself, and the client. He has also managed to do it with an extraordinarily positive attitude. I am extremely appreciative.",10,10
"James is an excellent supervisor who provides clear direction and timelines, valuable context (I was recently added to this client so it is helpful to understand the folks at the company we are interacting with), and good precedent for drafting novel docs, in addition to him being an excellent lawyer.",10,9
"I have been extremely impressed by Jamess work product and attention to detail. He is very proactive and has consistently taken the initiative to answer client questions in a timely manner when they come in. James ""runs"" with his assignments and takes complete ownership of his work. He is an excellent junior associate with a bright future!",10,10
"I dont have much constructive feedback to report, other than my recommendation to continue getting reps (on both the company and investor side). James has great instincts, which will only get better as he continues to hone his substantive knowledge of legal issues. As a junior associate, he should continue to ask questions of the mid and senior associates on his team to understand the ""why"" behind our recommendations to the client. I have no doubt that as James becomes more experienced, he will be running client relationships as the lead associate with a partner.",10,9
"You did a great job getting this deal from zero to closed. I really appreciate your feedback and comments, and I think you have developed a great understanding of what is important and what isnt. Your markups were very helpful in speeding along my review, and I think you did a great job negotiating the opposite side.",10,10
"My only constructive feedback is related to deal process efficiency. As we discussed, its often valuable to get specialist feedback in the early stages of a markup, but I think once youre at short strokes in a financing, its reasonable (from a cost-efficiency perspective and a deal velocity perspective) to not send minor changes back to the specialists.",10,8
James tries hard and is responsive.,10,7
James does not understand the substantive issues that have arisen during the transaction and is therefore unable to effectively run the transaction as the senior associate on the matter. James does not take notes during conversations or does not correctly understand what is discussed in team conversations and does not follow up with questions about items that he does not understand.James does not succinctly and clearly identify issues or provide clear recommendations to clients regarding transaction matters.,10,4
Generally your work product is strong when you deliver.,10,9
"Time entries can be a bit heavy at times. You should be mindful of this, especially when companies are looking to cut their spending. Figuring out how to streamline your work before getting started on it could help you with this. Sometimes you are in the background and need to be pushed to work on things. I need you to get to a point where you are not waiting for the senior associate/partner to tell you what to do or what to move forward.",10,6
Bob is a cool attorney to work with.  He is alright when assisting clients and pretty knowledgeable when it comes to his area of expertise.,10,8
Bob is an ass. I hate everything about him and I wish he would leave the firm.,2,2
Bob is freaking amazing.  He is a goddamn angel when it comes to saving my ass when shit hits the fan.,4,9
"Bob is a colleague that I do not want to work with going forward.  While Bob is recognized as a high performing attorney within his practice area, the projects that I ran with him proved to be very difficult and emotional.   Though I appreciate his time, I would like to work with someone else.",10,7
